# Custom_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_spaCy
Named entity recognition done for a project where we need to do NER for clinical trial summary reports (CSR). Here due to security breach I am doing on general data
1. We need to extract the text from CSR reports using OCR. (Tesseract for OCR and Bert for auto correction)
2. NER on clinical text
3. Entity identification like patient names, blood group, personal datails like age, antigens complex etc.
4. MASK the personal entity like REDACT, Replace, Ignore
5. Save to PDF and send to client
